# Duplicate Zeros #
Q. Given a fixed-length integer array arr, duplicate each occurrence of zero, shifting the remaining elements to the right.
Note that elements beyond the length of the original array are not written. Do the above modifications to the input array in place and do not return anything.
Example 1:
Input: arr = [1,0,2,3,0,4,5,0]
Output: [1,0,0,2,3,0,0,4]
Explanation: After calling your function, the input array is modified to: [1,0,0,2,3,0,0,4]

Example 2:
Input: arr = [1,2,3]
Output: [1,2,3]
Explanation: After calling your function, the input array is modified to: [1,2,3]

Solution 1: 
class Solution:
    def duplicateZeros(self, arr: List[int]) -> None:
        len_ = len(arr)
        possible_dups = 0
        while( possible_dups < len_):
            if arr[possible_dups] == 0:
                arr.insert(possible_dups, 0) # possible_dups=index, 0=item
                arr.pop() # remove the last element of the array and also returns the removed element. This function decreases the len of array by 1.
                possible_dups += 2
                continue
            else:
                possible_dups += 1
